# CakePHP Sandbox APP - How to setup

If you want to contribute, these are the basic steps to get the repo to run locally.

### Installation

First, clone the repo into a root folder:

	git clone https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-sandbox.git

Then make sure, core + all plugins are also available.

	composer install

Consider using a vhost setup to map the base path to `http://sandbox.local/`.
This will ensure that all linked assets will be found. Should also work without, though.

Then:

* Set up your `app_local.php` file in `/config`.
This will not be version-controlled. I use it for email setup, API keys and core salt value etc.
* Make sure you are in debug mode (2).

Take the `/config/Migrations/0_sandbox_first_manual_init.sql` and execute it.
This gives you all the basic tables.
Use the Migrations plugin to add the rest of the SQL:
```
bin/cake Migrations migrate
```

Everything should be up and running.

### Contributing

* Use the Sandbox plugin to create more sandbox functionality
* Submit your changes via PR (pull request).

Please check the quality of your changes via [CodeSniffer](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-codesniffer),
ideally with my MyCakePHP sniff package. You can use my convenience shell command that
also includes auto-correction for found issues:

	cake CodeSniffer.CodeSniffer run -s MyCakePHP -p Sandbox -v

To correct fixable errors:

	cake CodeSniffer.CodeSniffer run -s MyCakePHP -p Sandbox -v -f
